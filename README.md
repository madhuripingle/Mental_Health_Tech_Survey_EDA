Mental health is a crucial aspect of our overall well-being, influencing how we think, feel, and interact with the world around us. It encompasses our emotional resilience, our ability to handle stress, and our capacity to form and maintain healthy relationships. Good mental health is vital for leading a fulfilling and productive life.

Work constitutes a significant portion of our lives, where we invest a substantial amount of our time to earn income and cultivate friendships. Having a satisfying job can positively impact our mental well-being and overall quality of life.

Understanding the importance of mental health is essential because it affects every facet of our daily existence. Here are some key points to consider:

**Well-Being:** Good mental health contributes to a sense of well-being, allowing individuals to experience life's joys and challenges more effectively.</br>
**Productivity:** Mental health plays a significant role in our productivity, both at work and in our personal lives. It influences our motivation, focus, and problem-solving abilities.</br>
**Relationships:** Healthy mental well-being fosters positive relationships. It enables us to communicate effectively, empathize with others, and build strong connections.</br>
**Resilience:** Good mental health equips individuals with the tools to cope with life's ups and downs. It helps us bounce back from adversity and adapt to change.</br>
**Physical Health:** Mental health and physical health are interconnected. Neglecting one can affect the other, leading to various health issues.

Addressing mental health issues requires a multi-faceted approach, including raising awareness, reducing stigma, providing access to mental health services, and promoting self-care and emotional well-being. It's essential for individuals to prioritize their mental health and seek help when needed, just as they would for physical health concerns.

Recognizing its importance and addressing mental health issues at home as well as at work place are crucial steps toward a healthier and more resilient society.

This project involves a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset.

This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

The analysis includes:
Cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, correcting outliers, and data type conversion)

Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate visualizations (UBM) to identify patterns

Analysis of mental health treatment behavior across different genders, age groups, employment types, and work environments

Key focus on how work interference, remote work, and company support influence treatment-seeking behavior

By identifying high-risk groups and support gaps, this project helps build actionable recommendations for organizations to create a more inclusive and responsive mental health environment.
